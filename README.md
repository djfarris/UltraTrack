# UltraTrack
UltraTrack 4.1 is a software program for tracking muscle fascicle length and orientation changes through sequences of B-mode ultrasound images. It implements an affine extension to an optic flow algorithm to track movement of the muscle fascicle end-points throughout the sequence of images. The underlying algorithm has been previously described and its reliability tested, but here we present the software implementation with features for: tracking multiple fascicles in multiple muscles simultaneously; correcting temporal drift in measurements; manually adjusting tracking results; saving and re-loading of tracking results and loading a range of file formats. The source code was written in MatlabTM and is available as well as standalone executable versions for MacOS and Windows platforms that do not require a MatlabTM license to be installed and run.
